I have used **Heroku**, **Redis** and lots of gems, for example **RSpec** and **Cucumber** for testing. I had some experience in **Test Driven Development** and I hope that I can try the **Data-driven Development** in production environment.
I am skilful in **SQL** I have created lots of queries with complex joins and subqueriesy, most of them in **PostgreSQL**. I like and prefer the strict code review processes with git. When I code I follow the **OOP**, **Clean Code** and **SOLID** principles. I am familiar with **Python** and **JavaScript** and I am open to improvinge my knowledge.
